CPU core: a core includes a physical component that do shit
CPU thread: CPU can use both the rising and falling edge to trigger registers. This is called hyper-threading. Effectively, one single physical CPU can be used as two logical CPU. This, in CPU spec, is called CPU threads. This is different than threading in operational systems.
thread: if it&rsquo;s not specifically specified, a thread refers to an OS thread.
