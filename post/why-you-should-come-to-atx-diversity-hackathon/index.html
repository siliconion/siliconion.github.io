    <h1>Why You Should Come to ATX Diversity Hackathon</h1>

    

    <p>The Annual Austin Diversity Hackathon - #ATXDivHack - is coming back for the 5th time in September 20~22, 2019! If you are still wondering if you should come &ndash; you totally should! And here are the reasons.</p>
<p>I love #ATXDivHack so much. I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; for the last 3 years, and am the organizer this year. #ATXDIVHACK is a beginner friendly, inclusive, and fun event. The goal is for all participants to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn something new</li>
<li>Make friends and connections</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="learn-something-new">Learn something new</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see that one can learn something new technically - a new technology, library, framework, etc. With only 2 days to finish and very helpful mentors, this can be a great crush course of your own choice!</p>
<p>There are even more non-technical skills to gain! Project management, feature definition, how to work in a team, manage a team, coach a team&hellip;If you are self-taught and have been working alone, this is a good time to practice these skills.</p>
<h4 id="make-friends-and-connections">Make friends and connections</h4>
<p>People come here to collaborate. I&rsquo;m not very social, but it&rsquo;s very easy to start a conversation: start by asking what they are making/want to make!</p>
<p>I have met so many cool people, some I become good friends with, some become mentors. I have also gotten interview opportunities.</p>
<h4 id="have-fun">Have fun!</h4>
<p>I mean, why would you spend your weekend on something that&rsquo;s not fun?</p>
<p>Not sure what to make? See <a href="http://siliconion.github.io/post/what-to-make-at-atx-diversity-hackathon/">the next post</a> to get some ideas!</p>
