    <h1>Hugo deploy to GitHub</h1>

    

    <p>This blog is powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It is so easy to use! Hugo blogs can be easily deployed to GitHub by following <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>The only 2 things I had problem with were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When first deployed, my GitHub page kept 404 although all html files are update in the my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.github.io repo. To solve this, go to &ldquo;settings&rdquo; in the repo, scroll down to &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo;, make sure the correct branch is chosen in the source. Also choose a Jekyll theme even we are not using Jekyll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I followed the doc and created a submodule, and in no time it&rsquo;s all messed up. Git submodule is a mystery not worth solving. So I cloned the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.github.io repo outside of my source repo, and copy the files in public into it. My modified script is <a href="https://github.com/siliconion/siliconion_hugo/blob/master/deploy.sh">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I probably should setup CD but meh.</p>
